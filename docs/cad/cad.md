Our team use AutoDesk software "Fusion 360" for desiging.Here is a little description of it -

### Introduction of CAD (Fusion 360)

Autodesk Fusion 360 is a highly popular and versatile computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software platform developed by Autodesk. Fusion 360 offers a wide range of features and capabilities that make it an excellent choice for various design and engineering tasks. Here are some key details about Autodesk Fusion 360:

1. **Integrated Design and Manufacturing**:
   Fusion 360 provides a seamless integration of CAD and CAM tools, allowing designers and engineers to create 3D models and then generate toolpaths for machining and manufacturing. This integration streamlines the product development process by reducing the need to switch between different software packages.

2. **Cloud-Based Platform**:
   Fusion 360 is a cloud-based platform, which means that design data can be stored, accessed, and shared online. This facilitates collaboration among team members in different locations and allows for real-time updates and access to projects from multiple devices.

3. **Parametric Modeling**:
   Fusion 360 supports parametric modeling, allowing users to create 3D models with design parameters that can be easily modified. This feature makes it simple to update designs and explore different variations.

4. **Assembly Modeling**:
   Users can create complex assemblies and simulate the movement and interactions of components. This is especially useful for mechanical and product design where the functionality of moving parts needs to be tested.

5. **Simulation and Analysis**:
   Fusion 360 includes simulation and analysis tools to test the structural integrity of designs, analyze heat transfer, and perform modal analysis. This aids in optimizing designs for performance and reliability.

6. **Rendering and Visualization**:
   The software offers robust rendering and visualization tools that allow users to create photorealistic renderings of their designs, making it easier to present and communicate ideas to clients and stakeholders.

7. **Generative Design**:
   Fusion 360 incorporates generative design capabilities that use algorithms to automatically generate design options based on specified parameters. This can lead to more innovative and efficient designs.

8. **Electronics Design**:
   Fusion 360 has expanded to include electronics design capabilities, making it suitable for PCB (printed circuit board) design. Users can create schematics, layout PCBs, and collaborate on electronic design projects.

9. **Additive Manufacturing**:
   Fusion 360 supports 3D printing and additive manufacturing processes. Users can prepare and optimize models for 3D printing and take advantage of generative design to create lightweight and efficient structures.

10. **Community and Education**:
    Autodesk Fusion 360 has a vibrant community of users, and Autodesk offers educational licenses, making it accessible to students and educators for learning and teaching purposes.

Autodesk Fusion 360 has gained popularity among professionals and hobbyists in various industries, including mechanical engineering, product design, industrial design, and more. Its combination of 3D modeling, simulation, and integrated CAM tools makes it a comprehensive solution for the entire product development process, from concept to manufacturing.

### AUTOCAD (CAD software)
1.What is AutoCAD?

AutoCAD is a 2D and 3D computer-aided design (CAD) software application for desktop, web, and mobile developed by Autodesk.
It is a general drafting and design application used in industry by architects, project managers, engineers, graphic designers, city planners and other professionals to prepare technical drawings.

2.Background

The first version of AutoCAD by Autodesk was released in 1982. It was for CP/M and IBM PC platforms as a desktop app running on microcomputers with internal graphics controllers.
AutoCAD remained dominant because of its yearly continuous updates. The 2022 version release is the 36th major release of AutoCAD for Windows and the 12th consecutive year of AutoCAD for Mac.
Currently, AutoCAD has a multitude of specialized auxiliary tools which cover every kind of industrial fields related to 2D design and 3D modeling.

3.Languages and extensions

AutoCAD is available in 14 languages: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Czech, Polish and Hungarian (also through additional language packs).

AutoCAD supports a number of APIs for customization and automation. These include AutoLISP, Visual LISP, VBA, .NET and ObjectARX. 
ObjectARX is a C++ class library, which was also the base for:

* products extending AutoCAD functionality to specific fields
* creating products such as AutoCAD Architecture, AutoCAD Electrical, AutoCAD Civil 3D 
*third-party AutoCAD-based application.

The disciplined specific enhancements we also find for AutoCAD are:
* Advance Steel
* AutoCAD Architecture
* AutoCAD Electrical
* AutoCAD Map 3D
* AutoCAD Mechanical
* AutoCAD MEP
* AutoCAD Plant 3D
* Autodesk Civil 3D

4.Advantages of AutoCAD

* Accurate and Reduced Errors
* Save Time & Money
* Easier Data Transfer
* Controllable
* Database for manufacturing
* Easier Import/ Export of file
* Apply Point Clouds
* Layering feature

5.How to get AutoCAD?

Step 1: Access the Autodesk website

Use web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc. Then Go to the AutoCAD official website by using this link: https://www.autodesk.com.

Step 2: Select Students and Educators from the Menu drop-down list.

It will give you three options, i.e., free trials, students and educators, and worldwide sites. Here I am selecting the students and educators’ option.

Step 3: You will see Get set up for career success with the Autodesk tab. Click Start now under the Download free software option from that tab.

Step 4: It will list Autodesk products like 3DS Max, Maya, AutoCAD, etc. Under that, click on the AutoCAD option from the list.

Step 5: If you have registered, click Sign in, and the system will forward you to your Autodesk Login information. Otherwise, click Create Account and create a new account using your email ID.

Step 6: Select the version

After signing in, you can select the version of AutoCAD you want to download and install and Operating System: 32-bit(2019 and previous version) or 64-bit.

Then choose a language which is preferable for you.

The Serial number and product key will be displayed. Copy this information as required for activation after installing the software to authenticate the download.

Now click on download. You will see a prompt with a security warning from the download. In that prompt, click “Run” or “Ok” (which is applicable to continue the download process), as Autodesk products are relatively secure.

Step 7: License and Services Agreement

After that, you will see the “License and Services Agreement” Prompt. Read it carefully, click on the “I Accept” option, and click the next button to install AutoCAD on your Windows System.

The AutoCAD Download Manager will display. Moreover, this can take some time.

Step 8: After installing the manager, you will see an “Autodesk Download Manager” window. Specify the desired path where you want to save that file and click on OK.

The Autodesk Download Manager will be loading. This may take some time.

Step 9: After that, you will see a window where you can configure the AutoCAD installation process. However, here we give the path where you want to save the files.

Step 10: In the next window, select the Custom Option. Make sure all the features under the drop-down are checked.

Step 11: Then, the next window will prompt. Click on the Install option.

Step 12: After installing all the products and tools related to AutoCAD, Click on Finish.

Step 13: After the installation, you must provide a Product Key to further use AutoCAD.

In case you haven’t copied the Product Key previously, sign in to your Autodesk account on the website -> Click on your username -> Click on Autodesk Account.

Step 14: Click on the “All Products and Services” option. This will show the products you have downloaded.

Step 15: Under the AutoCAD option, click on the “More actions” drop-down -> click “Serial numbers”.

Now you can see the Serial Numbers and the Product Keys of all the products you downloaded. Copy this information and activate your Autodesk product.

Thus, now you can use AutoCAD software and design your models easily.
