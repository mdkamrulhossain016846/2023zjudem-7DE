 ### Final project's Draft 

 <h1 align="center">A SMART MULTIFUTIONARY DUSTBIN FOR LDC</h1>
 <h2>Background Information</h2>
 A lot of public places in least developed areas mostly rural areas still use open bins or bins with foot pedal for clinical waste, as a result sometimes when the petal malfunctions, the waste is not disposed off well leading to poor hygiene. At times the design of the bins permits it to overfill or overflow resulting on some waste ending up on the floor.
The dustbin can also be used in other places such as kitchen, living room, bathroom, bedroom, etc.

<h2>Product Idea</h2>
To design a smart dustbin that senses motion and opens, and its also able to sense the amount of waste inside it, when the waste exceed a certain point it put on the red light and refuses to open even when it senses motion. A vacuum will be added to clean the area where the dustbin will be used.
The plan is to cover the SDG 3& 6 for sanitation along with good health and well being. This is because its through proper sanitation that the health of people cannot be compromised.

 <h1 align="center">SMART BODY TEMPERATURE BABY BRACELET</h1>
 The smart body temperature baby bracelet is a device that contains a smart thermometer which 
is wearable and continuously monitors the temperature of a baby, alarming the parent or 
caretaker wherever the temperature becomes abnormal.

<h2>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</h2>

According to research, heat stress and hyperthermia are common findings in sudden infant 
death syndrome (SIDS) victims. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is been defined as “the 
sudden death of an infant under 1 year of age whereas Hyperthermia is defined as an 
abnormally high body temperature caused by a failure of the heat-regulating mechanisms of 
the body to deal with the heat coming from the environment (The National Institutes of health-NIH). Due to the abnormal high body temperature of the baby, some babies end up dying.

Certain study done by Stanton in 1984, it showed that from 34 SIDS victims 
studied, “19 babies were unusually hot or sweating when found dead; 14 died in an unusually 
warm environment; 17 had evidence of a terminal infective illness; and 24 were excessively 
clothed or overwrapped. In 6 of 15 babies (40%) whose rectal temperature was recorded after 
death, the temperature was above 37°C, the highest being 42°C”. Profuse sweating has been 
found on the scene of SIDS, and some SIDS twins were found covered with abundant sweat. This bring us to the conclusion that considering this study results a lot of infant death were 
related to a high temperature in babies.

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

Infant death is a problem affecting people worldwide, hence a need to bring about products that 
solve or reduce infant death rate is of high importance. With the background information 
provided it shows that one way of reducing death rates could be through regulating their 
temperatures not to reach the abnormal stage. Therefore, our group will be based on improving 
the existing smart watches available.

### PROJECT PLAN ****************************************************************************************

- Modify the existing baby smart body temperature bracelet as a develop a unique smart infant temperature monitoring bracelet that continuously monitors a baby's body temperature and provides real-time alerts to parents and caregivers when abnormalities are detected.
- Think of rural areas with less technology.
- Make the manufacture cost effective.
- Lullaby music for the baby's relaxation.
